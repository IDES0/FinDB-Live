## Overview
FinDB Live is a Flask-based financial data application designed for real-time retrieval and analysis of financial data. Unlike the original **FinDB Core**, which stores and organizes extensive financial datasets in a relational database, FinDB Live dynamically fetches data on-demand, allowing users to access the latest market information without relying on stored data.

## Features
- **Real-Time Stock Data Retrieval**: Access live stock data, indexes, and financial metrics through on-demand API requests.
- **Dynamic Search and Filtering**: Quickly search for stocks, indexes, and sectors using a responsive interface.
- **No Persistent Storage**: Data is fetched in real-time, so no storage of data in databases is required.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Integrates data processing capabilities, allowing quick insights on the retrieved financial data.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: By eliminating database storage, FinDB Live offers a faster, streamlined approach for live data analysis.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Data Retrieval APIs**: `yfinance`, `yahooquery` for financial data, `requests` for handling API requests
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for data manipulation
- **String Matching**: FuzzyWuzzy and Levenshtein for flexible search functionality
- **Production Setup**: Gunicorn and Flask-CORS for cross-origin resource sharing

## Usage

1. **Retrieve Live Data**: Perform dynamic queries for stock data, sectors, and indexes, with each request fetching the latest available information.
   
2. **Data Analysis**: Use integrated data processing tools like Pandas to explore trends and visualize real-time metrics.

3. **Search Functionality**: Leverage fuzzy matching for approximate search results based on partial or similar names, especially useful for stocks and sectors.

### Example Queries
- **On-Demand Stock Data**: Fetch current price, volume, and other details for specific stocks by ticker.
- **Real-Time Sector and Industry Insights**: View performance metrics for sectors and industries, refreshed at each request.
- **Approximate Search**: Locate stocks or indexes with similar names using fuzzy search for a more user-friendly experience.

## API Integration

FinDB Live uses **Yahoo Finance** and **YahooQuery** APIs for live financial data.

- **Real-Time Data**: Both `yfinance` and `yahooquery` are used to fetch up-to-date data on stocks, indexes, and other instruments.
- **Search and Matching**: Utilizes FuzzyWuzzy and Levenshtein libraries to improve the accuracy and flexibility of search results.
- **Data Processing**: With Pandas, FinDB Live can process data on-the-fly, providing immediate insights based on the latest retrieved data.
